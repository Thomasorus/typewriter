Typewriter is a work in progress desktop and web application that aims to regroup all my tools.

Typewriter should be:

- Portable
- Offline first
- Fast

Typewriter should allow me to:

- Edit my wiki
- Input time
- Add journal entries
- Compile images
- Drag and drop images and files

Ideals:

- Dependance free
- As light as possible

Design ideas:

- Each action should have its own borderless windows
- You can trigger each windows with a shortcut
